</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>I'm pretentious. I like to think of myself as some thinker. Fuck, this blog is prententious. Who do I think I am? Some JD Salinger over here trying to write all casually to make some deep point?</p>
<p>I'm such a poser. I say I do certain things. I say I like things I don't like that much. I say I use things that I barely understand.</p>
<p>And it shows. Everyone knows. Everyone can tell and I still do it. People make fun of me for it and I still do it. People mock me for it and I still do it. Why.</p>
<p>And the end of it all, I say I don't care about what others think. I say I'm better, I'm strong, independent thinking, wise. Because Buddha was an independent thinker, and so am I. But I'm here writing a blog post under some phony quasi-intellectual pen name, about why I care. Why I care so much about what people think of me.</p>
<p>What makes me this way? Is it my childhood where father would call me a "dumb kid" and a "sick kid" for getting a cross multiplication wrong? Or was it because of the high standards he put on me, which I now put on myself, and predictably fail to acheive. Even achievement feels useless. There's always something else.</p>
<p>But many others have more fucked up childhoods, and they look fine. I guess I look fine too. I look great on paper. A happy person, leading a 'successful' life with a 'solid career'. That noise is what gets respect. People don't look at you, they look at your credentials. Everything is numbers, money, fakes, lies.</p>
<p>They probably talk behind me at work. I'm a weird guy. Quiet. Socially inept, or at least they see it that way. If only they'd seen me around my friends; I'm only socially inept among mean people. Because I'm scared of being judged. But I judge so quickly.</p>                </article>
